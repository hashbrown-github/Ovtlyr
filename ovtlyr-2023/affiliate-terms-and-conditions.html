          <!-- <p class="grey_color">Last Updated: November 28, 2022</p> -->

        <div class="policies_sec">
          <h2>These terms of service ("<b>TOS</b>", "<b>terms</b>", "<b>conditions</b>", "<b>disclaimers</b>", "<b>contract</b>", or "<b>agreement</b>") are entered into between OVTLYR, Inc. , doing business as OVTLYR.com, (“<b>OVTLYR</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, or “<b>our</b>”) and the entity joining the OVTLYR affiliate program (“<b>Affiliate</b>”, “<b>you</b>”, or “<b>your</b>”).</h2>
          <p>This Affiliate Agreement contains the complete terms and conditions between OVTLYR Inc. ("<b>We</b>", "<b>us</b>", "<b>OVTLYR</b>"), the Affiliate ("<b>you</b>", "<b>Affiliate</b>") regarding your participation in OVTLYR's Commission Referral Program (the "<b>Affiliate Program</b>").</p>
          <p>By using the Platform and Services described in this document and marketed at OVTLYR.com, or subscribing to the services on the OVTLYR.com website, you are attesting that you have read, understand, and agree to these Terms, Conditions and Disclaimers and that you agree that your relationship with us is governed by the terms spelled out in the TOS. If you do not agree with these TOS, then you must immediately cease use of OVTLYR.com and any OVTLYR services or Platforms.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">I. Our Affiliate Network</h3>
          <p>To participate as an affiliate, you are required to sign up at <a href="https://ovtlyr.firstpromoter.com/" target="_blank">OVTLYR.FirstPromoter.com</a>. If you are a US resident, we will request that you provide us with your Social Security Number or Tax ID number for tax reporting purposes before we issue payment on any commissions.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">II. How it works</h3>
          <p>OVTLYR will provide You with Your unique tracking codes. These codes must be placed in the HTML of your website or shared on social media. When another web user clicks on your special link, it will direct the visitor to OVTLYR.com. If the user opens an account any time in the next 90 days (without clearing their cookies) from the same browser on the same computer or device, our automated system will track the sale and automatically credit your account. In order for automated tracking to be successful the visitor must have clicked on your tracking link, user must have cookies and javascript enabled in their browser, and user must not have cleared cookies before placing their order. If the automated tracking fails for any reason and you wish to earn commission for this referral you must contact OVTLYR Affiliate Support at <b>Support@OVTLYR.com</b>.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">III. Your Obligations</h3>
          <p>You agree to provide OVTLYR with accurate information when setting up your account, during our relationship, and when corresponding with us. On occasion, we may need to communicate with you by e-mail or telephone about the Services. You agree to maintain a working e-mail address that is monitored daily and to promptly inform us of any changes to your e-mail address or phone number. We have no responsibility, or liability, for interruptions in the Services, or damages of any sort, based on communications that are misdirected because of your failure to provide us with updated contact information.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">IV. Commissions and Payout Terms</h3>
          <p>Commissions will be paid to affiliates based on successful referrals. A successful referral, or sale, is defined as: non-fraudulent, active for a period of thirty (30) days, not cancelled OVTLYR Elite account, who has paid for services in full and has been directed to OVTLYR through your affiliate tracking link. Due to the high frequency of credit card fraud, affiliate commission fraud, and cancellation rates, OVTLYR reserves the right to hold commissions for up to 60 days for verification on a case-by-case basis. OVTLYR also reserves the right to claw-black or cancel any commission in the event that OVTLYR is unable to collect funds for services from the end user, or in the event that the order is found to be fraudulent, or in the event that the customer cancels and is refunded, or if OVTLYR learns that the commission was earned improperly through any means. There is one pay period per every month. Pay periods are 30 days long. Commissions are paid once they have matured for 60 days after they were awarded, or when the hold on the commission is released (no more than 60 days from the time the hold was placed.) This time frame allows us to evaluate every order and assert its validity. In the event we are unable to verify the order during this time frame, we may, at our sole discretion, cancel your commission and cancel the order. Cancelled commissions cannot be reinstated. Any commission cancellations will be documented to the Affiliate on request to show sufficient reason for cancellation. Commission rates are posted on <a href="https://ovtlyr.com/affiliates" target="_blank">www.OVTLYR.com/affiliates</a> and will be updated there. If you have received a custom commission from OVTLYR in exchange for a referral commitment, then OVTLYR will modify your account settings to reflect this.</p>
          <p>If you become non-subscriber then you will be automatically moved to our Prime Affiliate program with less payout as per mentioned on <a href="https://ovtlyr.com/affiliates" target="_blank">www.OVTLYR.com/affiliates</a></p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">V. Term of the Agreement</h3>
          <p>The term of this agreement will begin upon acceptance of OVTLYR's acceptance of Your Affiliate Program application, and will end when terminated by either involved party as indicated in this provision. You and OVTLYR reserve the right at any time to cancel this relationship, with or without cause, by giving 30 days’ notice of termination. Once terminated, you will not be eligible to receive commissions for any future referrals. OVTLYR may modify this agreement at any time upon 14 days’ notice.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-terms">VI. Termination for Material Breach</h3>
